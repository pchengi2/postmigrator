# README

postmigrator.py is a tool to help migrate backed up posts from Live Journal blog.
I used a tool called [Charm](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ljcharm/) to back up posts from my livejournal, but needed something to convert them into markdown,
to then feed jekyll, to get the resultant HTML content for my site, and postmigrator was the result.
It is extremely hackish, but gets the work done.
